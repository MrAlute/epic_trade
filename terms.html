                <h1>Terms and condition</h1><br>
                <h1>1. Objectives</h1><br>
                <p style="text-align: left;">It is the goal of Epiik Trade to help users enter and navigate the cryptocurrency space, and provide tools to help users make their own sound decisions relative to growing their wealth. Services are intended for medium- and long-term investors.                   
                </p><br>
                
                <h1>2. Activities</h1><br>
                <p>2.1 Account creation</p><br>
                <p>Epiik Trade will create the necessary crypto exchange accounts on behalf of, and with permission of the user. Once account set-up is complete, users are provided with the account credentials and password change instructions, at which point users will have full control over their account. Users are the full and sole owner of their exchange accounts and carry all responsibilities that come with opening, holding, and managing such accounts.</p><br>

                <p>2.2 Asset allocation</p><br>
                <p>Epiik Trade uses dynamic, proprietary algorithms to define and perform portfolio allocation, based on user input. Manual trades or transactions conducted by users may limit Epiik Trade’s account monitoring and reporting ability.</p><br>

                <p>2.3 Fund deposits and withdrawals</p><br>
                <p>Users are responsible for depositing and withdrawing funds to/from their account, however Epiik Trade will provide clear instructions on how to do so.</p><br>

                <h1>3. Fees</h1><br>
                <p>3.1 Promotions</p><br>
                <p>Epiik Trade reserves the right to apply promotional discounts to the fees listed under 3.1. This is completely at Epiik Trade’s discretion.</p><br>

                <p>3.2 Other fees</p><br>
                <p>Epiik Trade does not charge any additional or hidden fees. For any transaction or trading fees that may be charged by cryptocurrency exchanges and/or banks, users accept full responsibility.</p><br>

                <h1>4. Security</h1><br>
                <p>4.1 Infrastructure</p><br>
                <p>Epiik Trade is powered by Google Cloud. Google Cloud helps reducing the cost, complexity, and risk associated with security and compliance in the cloud.
                </p><br>

                <p>4.2 Exchanges</p><br>
                <p>Epiik Trade thoroughly vets its partners and only works with major “top-10” exchanges. User funds remain on their personal exchange account and interactions between Epiik Trade and user accounts are performed by means of customer owned API keys. API access is limited, hence in the unlikely event of a security breach, no fund withdrawal can take place.</p><br>


                <h1>5. Disclaimer</h1><br>
                <p>5.1 Financial advice</p><br>

                <p>5.2 Warranties</p><br>

                <p>5.3 Liability</p><br>
                <p>In no event can Epiik Trade or any of its owners be liable to users or any party related to users for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, lost profits, or losses, even if Epiik Trade has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                <h1>6. Risks</h1><br>
               
                <p>Investing in any asset class, including crypto currencies, holds numerous risks, for example: technology risks, exchange risks, security risks, regulatory risks.  Before deciding to leverage Epiik Trade services, users should carefully consider their investment objectives and risk appetite. The possibility exists that users lose some or all of their initial investment and therefore no money should be invested that users cannot afford to lose.
                </p><br>

              
                <p>As with any market, for a transaction to happen it requires a seller, a buyer, and a price agreement. Loss-limiting strategies such as stop-loss orders may not be effective because market conditions or technological issues may make it impossible to execute stop-loss orders. Epiik Trade is not responsible for any losses incurred as a result of using Epiik Trade’s advisory services.</p><br>
