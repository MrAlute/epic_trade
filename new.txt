 "A good broker executes customers orders efficiently and without error. A great broker, however, is also a special breed of Trade Analysts with a deep understanding of what really moves the markets. This understanding enables them to extract every possible point from trades which is often the difference between a winning and losing year. Harvard Fx Trade is a great broker!"
